# DAY 9 : ***Object Properties, Descriptors & Prototypes***

- 👋 **Hello Everyone!** 

- Here is my **Day 9 progress**, where I explored some deep and powerful concepts in JavaScript related to **objects and prototypes!**

---
- 📘 Topics I covered :

- **Object Properties Configuration**
    - [✔️]  **➡️ Property Flags & Descriptors**
    - [✔️]  **➡️ Property Getters & Setters**
    
- 🔗 You can check my progress here:  [Code Files](https://github.com/StaytunedLAB/utkarsh-prajapati-2304030101336/tree/JS-part-1/src/Object_properties_configuration)

- **Prototypes & Inheritance**
    - [✔️]  **➡️ Prototypal Inheritance**
    - [✔️]  **➡️ F.prototype**
    - [✔️]  **➡️ Native Prototypes**
    - [✔️]  **➡️ Prototype Methods & Objects Without __proto__**
    
- 🔗 You can check my progress here:  [Code Files](https://github.com/StaytunedLAB/utkarsh-prajapati-2304030101336/tree/JS-part-1/src/Prototypes%20inheritance)

---
- 🧠 These topics gave me a deeper understanding of how JavaScript objects work behind the scenes, how inheritance is handled, and how to control property behavior at a low level.

- 💻 I practiced these concepts with real code examples to build a strong understanding of prototype chains and property descriptors.
